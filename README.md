# my_MLProjects
As a bioinformatician who has dealt with large-scale datasets, primarily next-generation sequencing (NGS) genomic data, 
I was super eager to expand my toolkit to make the most out of big data. After having finished my PhD, while exploring directions to grow my skills in, I decided to dive into the world of machine learning. 

At the time this repository was created, I had just finished taking two courses on machine learning where I learned how to: 
1. Train regression and classification algorithms (NumPy, scikit-learn)
2. Build neural networks (Keras, TensorFlow)
3. Build decision trees (sci-kit learn, XGBoost)
4. Apply diagnostic tools to optimize models (bias, variance, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score)

This repository contains machine learning projects I've built, mostly using datasets on Kaggle. All data sources are cited and I've uploaded Jupyter notebooks(for visualization) and `.py` files (easy execution) for each project. 

The goal behind creating this repository is mostly self-driven: to strengthen my understanding, improve my model training skills, 
and dive deeper into more advanced ML algorithms. However, feedback and discussions are always welcome!
